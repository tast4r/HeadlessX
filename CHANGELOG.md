## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-15 🏗️ **MAJOR MODULAR ARCHITECTURE REFACTOR**

### 🚀 Revolutionary Changes
- **Complete Modular Refactor**: Transformed 3079-line monolithic `server.js` into 20+ focused modules
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean architecture with distinct layers for configuration, services, controllers, and middleware
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility for better code organization
- **Production-Ready**: Enterprise-grade error handling, logging, and monitoring capabilities
- **Developer Experience**: Improved development workflow with clear module boundaries

### 🏗️ New Modular Architecture
```
src/
├── config/         # Configuration management
├── utils/          # Utilities (errors, logging, helpers)
├── services/       # Business logic (browser, stealth, rendering)
├── middleware/     # Express middleware (auth, errors)
├── controllers/    # Request handlers by feature
├── routes/         # Route definitions and mappings
├── app.js          # Main application setup
└── server.js       # Entry point for PM2
```

### ✨ Major Features Added
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Structured error responses with correlation IDs for debugging
- **Advanced Rate Limiting**: Intelligent rate limiting with memory-based storage and cleanup
- **Improved Logging**: Structured logging with request correlation and detailed context
- **Better Browser Management**: Optimized browser lifecycle with resource monitoring

- **Performance Optimization**: Better resource utilization and memory management

### 🔧 Configuration Updates
- **Environment Variables**: `TOKEN` → `AUTH_TOKEN` (breaking change)
- **PM2 Configuration**: Moved from `config/ecosystem.config.js` to root `ecosystem.config.js`
- **Enhanced .env**: More configuration options with validation and defaults
- **Docker Optimization**: Updated Docker configuration for modular structure

- **Updated README**: Complete rewrite to reflect modular architecture and v1.2.0 features
- **API Documentation**: Updated all endpoint documentation for new structure
- **Setup Scripts**: Enhanced setup and deployment scripts for modular components

### 🛠️ Developer Experience Improvements
- **Module Independence**: Each module can be developed and tested independently
- **Clear Dependencies**: Explicit dependency injection and module interfaces
- **Better Debugging**: Enhanced error messages with stack traces and correlation IDs
- **Type Safety**: Improved code organization for better IDE support
- **Testing**: Individual modules can be unit tested separately

### 🐛 Performance & Reliability

### 💥 Breaking Changes
- **Environment Variable**: `TOKEN` environment variable renamed to `AUTH_TOKEN`
- **File Structure**: PM2 configuration moved from `config/` to root directory
- **Import Paths**: Internal imports updated for modular structure (affects custom modifications)
- **Script Updates**: Setup scripts updated to work with new architecture

### 🔄 Migration Guide
```bash
# Update environment variables
sed -i 's/TOKEN=/AUTH_TOKEN=/g' .env

# Update PM2 configuration path
mv config/ecosystem.config.js ./ecosystem.config.js

# Restart services
npm run pm2:restart
```

### 📦 Dependencies
- **Added**: Enhanced dependencies for better module organization
- **Optimized**: Removed unused dependencies from the monolithic structure
- **Updated**: Latest versions of core dependencies for security and performance
